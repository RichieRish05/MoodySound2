Training Process:

1. We define whether our not the process will run on the gpu or cpu by configuring our device

2. We begin by defining the hyperparameters of our training such as batch size, input data size, etc.

3. We then define our dataset.

4. We then load in our data using pytorch's DataLoader

5. Iterate through the dataloader and compute forward pass, gradient descent, then reset the optimizer gradients

6. Test using validation set
