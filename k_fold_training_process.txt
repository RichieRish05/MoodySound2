Training Process:

1. We define whether our not the process will run on the gpu or cpu by configuring our device

2. We begin by defining the hyperparameters of our training such as batch size, input data size, etc.

3. We then define our dataset.

4. We then use sk_learns KFold class to compute a k fold cross validation split

5. While iterating through the folds, we define subsamplers to randomly sample our train and test data

6. We then define a train and test dataloader

7. Initialize the model and reset weights

8. Initialize the optimizer

9. Run through the epochs

10. Iterate through the train dataloader and compute forward pass, gradient descent, then reset the optimizer gradients

11. Test using validation set and remember to remove gradient calculation with "with torch.nograd()"
